mender-dist-packages
====================

Mender is an open source over-the-air (OTA) software updater for embedded Linux devices. Mender comprises a client running at the embedded device, as well as a server that manages deployments across many devices.

This repository contains mender-dist-packages, which is used to create distribution packages of the mender client software

## Getting started

To start using Mender, we recommend that you begin with the Getting started
section in [the Mender documentation](https://docs.mender.io/).

## Requirements

You need to [install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/install) to use this
environment. Then you need access to the registry.gitlab.com/northern.tech
container registry:

1. Create a new authentication token for the registry at
   https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/personal_access_tokens

2. Log in to the registry:

```bash
docker login registry.gitlab.com/northern.tech
```

If you don't have access to the above registry and need to build the container
images required for builds locally, see the `build.sh` script and `Dockerfile`
in the [mender-test-containers
repository](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-test-containers/tree/master/mender-dist-packages-building).


### Instructions

To build the DEB packages, run the `docker-build-package` script as follows:

```bash
./docker-build-package build-type distro release arch package-name [version] [save-orig]
```

The only supported `build-type` is `crosscompile`. `distro`, `release` and
`arch` define the target OS. `distro` and `release` can currently be one of the
following combinations:

- `debian`: `bullseye`, `bookworm`
- `ubuntu`: `focal`, `jammy`, `noble`

These combinations change in time with new distribution releases and old
releases going out of support.

The `arch` argument specifies the architecture to build the package(s) for and
can be one of the following values:

- `armhf`
- `arm64`
- `amd64`

The `package-name` and `version` define what should be built. Possible package
names correspond to the Mender components:

- `mender-app-update-module`
- `mender-artifact`
- `mender-cli`
- `mender-client4`
- `mender-connect`
- `mender-configure`
- `mender-gateway`
- `mender-flash`
- `mender-monitor`
- `mender-setup`
- `mender-snapshot`
- `mender-orchestrator`
- `mender-orchestrator-support`

The default value for `version` is `master`. An exact version of a package
(usually a tag in the component's repository) can be specified. The `version`
also specifies the version of the recipes used. If there is a recipe for the
specific `version` in the respective `recipes/$package-name` directory, it is
used. Otherwise the `debian-master` recipe for the given package is used.

*Note: Some recipes for past versions of various packages can be found in git
history.*


When building the `.orig` tarball (which is needed for building actual `.deb`
packages), `save-orig` must be set to `true`.

A full example can then be:

```bash
./docker-build-package crosscompile debian bookworm amd64 mender-flash 1.0.2 true
./docker-build-package crosscompile debian bookworm amd64 mender-flash 1.0.2
```

When finished, the packages should be ready in the `output/` directory.
